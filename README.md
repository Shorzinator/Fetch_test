# Details about Fetch_test

Hi Reviewer,
<br>
I Tried to answer **all** the queries that were listed on the test. In the questions where I had to provide insights form the data for a non-technical stakeholder, I have written the insight along with a query just to show how I got to that detail.

Details about the files I have added -
1. I have added the queries as an sql file along with a text file. You can try to run the SQL file directly in the database.
2. I have added the ER diagram, which I made using a digital tool which essential helped me do it in a more clean and quick manner as compared to doing it by hand.
<br>
Thank you!
